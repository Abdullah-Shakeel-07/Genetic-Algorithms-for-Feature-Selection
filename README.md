# Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection

## Goals
The aim of this project is to implement a genetic algorithm to select the most impactful features in a dataset. Additionally, I will demonstrate the results of the feature selection and compare them with the results obtained without any feature selection.

## Background and Motivation
Feature selection is an essential process in machine learning where redundant and irrelevant features are removed from a dataset. Evolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms, have proven to be effective for feature selection. The selected features often provide equally good or better results, and reducing the dimensionality of data offers several advantages:
- Faster training time
- Reduced overfitting
- Fewer data entries required

In this project, I will create a genetic algorithm to identify the best features for a given dataset. These features will be passed to a simple machine learning algorithm, which will return an accuracy score. This accuracy will serve as the fitness score for the genetic algorithm. The main objective is to maximize the accuracy.

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

### Parameter Optimization
Optimizing GA parameter values (population size, generation number, crossover rate, mutation rate, etc.) is crucial and these values are typically correlated. By testing different sets of parameter values, I will identify the most suitable ones for achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions.

### Process
The genetic algorithm will involve generating an initial population, selecting the best parents for offspring, performing crossover and mutation, and replacing the population. This process will be repeated until an end condition is met.

## Fitness Function
I will use a machine learning algorithm on the provided dataset to return an accuracy score, which will serve as the fitness function for the genetic algorithm. The goal is to maximize this accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of 8482 rows, each with 58 columns. The first 57 columns represent the features, while the last column represents the target value.

## Required Functions
The code will include the following mandatory functions (additional functions can be created as needed):
- `Preprocessing`
- `Create_population`
- `Fitness_function`
- `Crossover`
- `Mutation`
